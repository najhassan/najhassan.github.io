I have completed my master's degree from the Department of Computer Science, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR. Before UO, I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have worked on object detection and tracking, pose estimation, adversarial learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, etc.
